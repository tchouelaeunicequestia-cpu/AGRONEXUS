# AgroNexus Documentation & Deployment Hub

Welcome to the official repository for **AgroNexus: An Integrated Agricultural Management and Information Platform**.

AgroNexus is a comprehensive AgTech ecosystem designed to address post-harvest agricultural value chain inefficiencies in Central Africa and broader regional markets. The platform combines spatial e-commerce, automated escrow payments, cyber-physical IoT telemetry for storage monitoring, verified agronomy advisory, and domain-guarded Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI grounded in international agricultural standards (FAO, USDA, UNECE).

| 🌽 **Produce Catalog & Spatial (Epic 2)** | PostGIS `Point` produce listings (`ProductController.java`), Buyer `ST_DWithin` radial spatial search (5km–100km). | 65% |
| 💳 **Escrow & Payments (Epic 3)** | `EscrowEngineService` formula (5% platform service fee), Order entity, lock/disburse endpoints. Frontend checkout connection pending. | 45% |
| 🚚 **Transport & Logistics (Epic 4)** | Data model & `EscrowStatus` state enum created. Transporter UI & dispatch execution pending. | 10% |
| 🌡️ **IoT Storage Telemetry (Epic 5)** | Spring Boot telemetry REST ingestion (`TelemetryController.java`), safety threshold evaluation. UI dashboard seeded fallback data. | 50% |
| 🤖 **Domain-Guarded AI (Epic 6)** | Keyword-based agricultural prompt guardrail prototype (`AiAssistantController.java`). `pgvector` HNSW index & LLM integration pending. | 35% |
| 👤 **User Profile & Settings (Epic 7)** | Self-service profile editing and address management pending. | 0% |
| 🎯 **Overall Completion** | **Working Prototype / MVP Stage** | **~39–45%** |
